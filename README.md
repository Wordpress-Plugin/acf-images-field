Advanced Custom Fields - Images Field Extension
==============================================

### Discussion
http://advancedcustomfields.com/support/discussion/1350/multiple-images-field-for-flexible-field

Note: As of v3.1.5 ACF supports multiple images in field by default. Thus this addon is no longer needed.

Installation
------------

In your functions.php
`register_field('Images_field', dirname(__File__) . '/fields/images.php');`
